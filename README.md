>I am on Mac Ventura and have a folder '/Users/kerwin/Desktop/HCL to HCC'. Inside this folder are sub-directories like 'album1', 'album2', etc., each of which contains a varying number of mp3 files. These files need to stay in their respective sub-directories.
>
> For all the mp3 files inside the 'HCL to HCC' sub-directories, I need to edit the Artist field of the ID3v2 tag such that any occurrence of the sub-string 'HCL' is replaced with 'HCC' while leaving the rest of the Artist field intact. Example: 'HCL0797' would become 'HCC0797'. If the Artist tag does not start with 'HC', then print 'Metadata needs manual update'
>
>Please provide instructions on how I could automate this task, such as a Python script or using Mac's built-in Automator.
